    <h1>Play - BrowserSync</h1>
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open 2 shells at the root of the project</li>
      <li>Run <strong>npm install</strong> once in one of them to grap some dependencies</li>
      <li>Run <strong>sbt run</strong> in the first one, wait for it to finish. Play server should be running now.</li>
      <li>Run <strong>gulp</strong> in the other one. Now BrowserSync has a proxy on top of Play server.</li>
      <li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:9001">http://localhost:9001</a> to see the result.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Live reloading</h2>
    <p>Here are the files you can edit to see live-reloading in action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>app/views/index.scala.html</strong> : a Scala template, will trigger a full reload of the page, and so on a compilation of the template by Play</li>
      <li><strong>public/javascript/main.js</strong> : a JavaScript file, will trigger a full reload of the page</li>
      <li><strong>resources/less/main.less</strong> : a LESS file, watched by Gulp, that will be automatically compiled to "<strong>public/stylesheets/main.css</strong>" which is watched by BrowserSync and will be hot deployed (the page will be repainted with the new CSS without a full reload)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Multi devices sync</h2>
    <p>Since it's BrowserSync, you can open this website on several browsers, including smartphones, and enjoy full sync accross clicks, scrolling, etc... Feel free to open <a href="http://localhost:9001">http://localhost:9001</a> to several browsers and interact with them.</p>
